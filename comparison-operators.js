/*
    JavaScript has both strict and typeâ€“converting comparisons. A strict comparison (e.g., ===) is only true if the operands are of the same type and the contents match. 
    The more commonly-used abstract comparison (e.g. ==) converts the operands to the same type before making the comparison. 
    For relational abstract comparisons (e.g., <=), the operands are first converted to primitives, then to the same type, before comparison.

    Javascript has 8 comparison operators:

    1- Equality (==)
    Syntax:
        x == y
    
    2 - Inequality (!=)
    Sytax:
        x != y

    3 - Identity / strict equality (===)
    Sytax:
        x === y

    4 - Non-identity / strict inequality (!==)
    Syntax:
        x !== y

    5 - Greater than operator (>)
    Syntax:
        x > y

    6 - Greater than or equal operator (>=)
    Syntax:
        x >= y

    7 - Less than operator (<)
    Syntax:
        x < y

    8 - Less than or equal operator (<=)
    Syntax:
        x <= y
